# Ocha No Pozu

Ocha No P≈çzu (Tea Pose) is a game about a samurai warrior who fights monsters and eventually a final boss.  It is a 2D Platformer with a 32 bit artstyle written completely in Python with use of the PyGame library.  The world is procedurally generated to allow for maximum replayability.

This game is not intended as a full indie release, but rather as a small project.  It can be a bit laggy and buggy, but it was fun to make.

Artwork was made by Jeongwoo Choi and Brandon Braswell.
